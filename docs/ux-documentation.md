- **Level 3**: Detail view (complete information)
- **Level 4**: Action panels (specific operations)

#### Multi-Modal Communication
Status and feedback using multiple channels:
- **Visual**: Color coding for immediate recognition
- **Iconographic**: Universal symbols for quick understanding
- **Textual**: Clear descriptions for accessibility
- **Spatial**: Consistent positioning for pattern recognition

#### Responsive Interaction Patterns
- **Mobile**: Touch-optimized with swipe gestures
- **Tablet**: Hybrid touch/pointer interactions
- **Desktop**: Keyboard shortcuts and hover states
- **Cross-device**: Consistent core functionality

### Micro-Interactions

#### Hover States
```css
/* Subtle elevation and color shift */
.payment-card:hover {
  transform: translateY(-2px);
  border-color: #663399;
  box-shadow: 0 8px 24px rgba(102, 51, 153, 0.15);
}
```

#### Loading States
- **Button loading**: Spinner replaces text, button stays same size
- **Page loading**: Skeleton screens maintain layout
- **Data loading**: Progressive loading with clear feedback

#### Status Updates
